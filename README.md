### üîß Services

The integration provides these services for automation:

```yaml

service: aduro.set_heatlevel
data:
  heatlevel: 2

# Set target temperature
service: aduro.set_temperature
data:
  temperature: 22

# Set operation mode (0=Heat Level, 1=Temperature, 2=Wood)
service: aduro.set_operation_mode
data:
  mode: 1

# Start the stove
service: aduro.start_stove

# Stop the stove
service: aduro.stop_stove
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Simple Automation - Start stove when cold

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Start stove when cold"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.aduro_boiler_temperature
        below: 18
    condition:
      - condition: time
        after: "06:00:00"
        before: "22:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.aduro_stove_power
```

### Low Pellet Notification

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify when pellets low"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.aduro_pellet_percentage
        below: 20
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Aduro Stove"
          message: "Pellet level is {{ states('sensor.aduro_pellet_percentage') }}%"
```

## üé® Dashboard Example

Use Mushroom cards for a beautiful interface:

```yaml
type: vertical-stack
cards:
  - type: custom:mushroom-entity-card
    entity: switch.aduro_stove_power
    icon: mdi:fireplace
    name: Aduro Stove
    
  - type: custom:mushroom-number-card
    entity: number.aduro_heat_level
    icon: mdi:fire
    name: Heat Level
    
  - type: custom:mushroom-chips-card
    chips:
      - type: entity
        entity: sensor.aduro_boiler_temperature
      - type: entity
        entity: sensor.aduro_pellet_percentage
      - type: entity
        entity: sensor.aduro_power
```

## üîÑ Migration from Old Setup

If you're using the old manual YAML configuration:

1. **Backup your configuration**
2. **Install this integration via HACS** (see installation above)
3. **Configure the integration** through the UI
4. **Remove old YAML configuration**:
   - Remove `aduro.yaml` includes from `configuration.yaml`
   - Remove `pyduro_scripts.yaml` includes
   - Remove `mqtt_devices.yaml` includes
   - Remove old `python_scripts/pyduro_*.py` files
5. **Restart Home Assistant**
6. **Update your Lovelace dashboards** to use the new entity names

The new integration uses cleaner entity IDs like:
- `sensor.aduro_smoke_temperature` (was `sensor.aduro_h2_smoke_temperature`)
- `switch.aduro_stove_power` (was `input_boolean.aduro_start_stop`)
- `number.aduro_heat_level` (was `input_number.aduro_heatlevel`)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Integration not found
- Make sure you've restarted Home Assistant after installation
- Check that the `custom_components/aduro` folder exists

### Cannot connect to stove
- Verify your stove serial number and PIN are correct
- Check that your MQTT broker is running
- Ensure your stove is connected to your network
- Try the cloud address if local discovery fails (integration does this automatically)

### Entities not updating
- Check your MQTT broker logs
- Verify the pyduro and paho-mqtt dependencies installed correctly
- Enable debug logging (see below)

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.aduro: debug
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Legacy Documentation (Old Manual Setup)

The sections below are kept for reference but are **no longer needed** with the new integration.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand old documentation</summary>

### Old Entity Types (No longer needed - now created automatically)

**Utility Meter**: Tracks the amount of pellets consumed (aduro_consumed_amount_of_pellets).

**Counters**: Tracks the number of times the stove has been refilled without being cleaned (aduro_pellets_refill_counter).

**Input Booleans**: Toggles for starting/stopping the stove, toggling heat targets, and shutting down at specific pellet levels.

**Input Numbers**: Configurable values for heat levels, boiler reference temperature, pellet capacity, and notification thresholds.

**Input Buttons**: Buttons for marking the stove as refilled or cleaned.

### Old Manual Installation (Deprecated)

1. You will need a MQTT-broker. I use Mosquitto broker.
2. Follow instruction in https://github.com/SpaceTeddy/homeassistant_aduro_stove_control_python_scripts. Which includes installation of:
   * PythonScriptsPro (https://github.com/AlexxIT/PythonScriptsPro) for HA
   * pyduro (https://github.com/clementprevot/pyduro) as standard python library to get connection to the stove.
   * paho-mqtt (https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) library is required for python mqtt connectivity.  
3. I use Mushroom cards for the UI.
4. Update your configuration with the files and/or lines in the files.

**Note**: The above steps are no longer required! Just install via HACS as described in the installation section above.
